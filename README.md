# A manga list CRUD using JSON server

## About

The ideia of the project is to improve my mangalist that I already have using excel and learn/improve some basic CRUD on JS.<br>

I am also trying to put my codes in English, even that my English is not that good.<br>

The JS part was based on a course called "JS na web: CRUD com JavaScript ass√≠ncrono" form [Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/javascript-crud-assincrono).

## Technologies

- HTML
- Sass
- JavaScript
- JSON server
- Live server extension on VS Code

## What I Wanted to improve with this project

- Sass
- BEM methodology
- MVC
- Fetch API
- Async JavaScript
- JSON as database

## This to improve on the project

- Show the list in alphabetic order
- Put some buttons to order the list

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

```
npx json-server --watch db.json
```

Remember to use sudo if you are not using windows.

This project is for use in VSCode with liveserver or the CORS gets you :P

If you don't use VSCode you can install a [browser-sync](https://browsersync.io) package or something like that .
