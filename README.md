# MangaList_JSON-server
<h1>Basic CRUD with a search using JSON server.</h1>

<p>The JS part was based on a course form Alura called "JS na web: CRUD com JavaScript ass√≠ncrono".</p>
<p>https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/javascript-crud-assincrono</p><br>

<p>The ideia of the project is to improve my mangalist that I already have using excel and learn/exercise some basic CRUD on JS.</p><br>

<p>I am also trying to put my codes in English, even that my English is pretty bad.</p><br>

<p>You need to use 2 commands to run this project:</p>
<p>npm install</p>
<p>npx json-server --watch db.json </p><br>

<p>This project is for use in VSCode with liveserver or the CORS gets you :/</p>
<p>If you don't use VSCode you can install a browser-sync package or something like that </p>
<p>Remember to use sudo if you are not using windows.</p>
